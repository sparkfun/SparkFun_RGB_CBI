[*SparkFun RGB Addressable CBI LED 5mm - Right Angle (COM-23649)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23649)

This is a right angle 5mm addressable LED. It sounds boring, but at the time of writing, *this is the first one in the world*.

If you've ever tried to get a project into an enclosure, you know what a challenge it can be. Connectors are fairly straightforward. Oddly, getting a clean-looking, clear indicator to the outside world is trickier.

CBIs, or circuit board indicators, are a common way to get LEDs through the enclosure wall. The problem is that all the current LED suppliers and CBI models are from the 1980s when Modems were the king and needed lots of link indicators. When we wanted an addressable RGB CBI for our projects and couldn't find one, so we made it!

Inside is a single wire APA106/WS2812/Neopixel type RGB addressable LED with data in, and data out pins. Using the [FastLED library](https://fastled.io/), you'll be blinking in no time!

Why be locked into a single indicator LED color when you can drive *many* board edge indicators with a single wire, and make them any color or brightness! Welcome to the future.
